Data fetching in REST made easy

### Usage

> TODO:

### Features

- Suports Vue.js and React.js


```javascript
import something from 'mylib/dist/lib/something'
```

### NPM scripts

 - `npm t`: Run test suite
 - `npm start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode
 - `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
 - `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
 - `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
 - `npm run lint`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)


#### Setup steps

Follow the console instructions to install semantic release and run it (answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?").

_Note: make sure you've setup `repository.url` in your `package.json` file_

```bash
npm install -g semantic-release-cli
semantic-release-cli setup
# IMPORTANT!! Answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?" question. It is already prepared for you :P
```

From now on, you'll need to use `npm run commit`, which is a convenient way to create conventional commits.

Automatic releases are possible thanks to [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), which publishes your code automatically on [github](https://github.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), plus generates automatically a changelog. This setup is highly influenced by [Kent C. Dodds course on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)
